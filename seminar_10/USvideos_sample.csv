I'm proud for people that do that and I think it's wonderful for them, I love to watch them and I think it's really cool when people are genuine about it because they deserve whatever they want to spend their money on, I just don't have that in me which was what I was trying to express.  Like I said I have some nice things guilt which is why I don't have a lot of nice things lol, not because I don't think they're nice I just feel weird having nice things, a nice house included.  IDK OKAY ITS COMPLICATED.  But this house is so important to us, it's our freedom and future and we just couldn't be happier so thank you for always supporting us in whatever stupid stuff we decide to do and make.  It's been a long journey for me personally to get here, I know a lot of you have been here for years and I just want to say thank you.  I'm getting very emotional now so I'm just gonna stuff those feelings down and pretend they aren't happening lol.  I'm looking forward to ruining my future kitchen table with acrylic nail supplies etc. because the salon will live on know what I'm sayin.

From Disney and visionary director Tim Burton, the all-new grand live-action adventure “Dumbo” expands on the beloved classic story where differences are celebrated, family is cherished and dreams take flight. Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) enlists former star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) and his children Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins) to care for a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him a laughingstock in an already struggling circus. But when they discover that Dumbo can fly, the circus makes an incredible comeback, attracting persuasive entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), who recruits the peculiar pachyderm for his newest, larger-than-life entertainment venture, Dreamland. Dumbo soars to new heights alongside a charming and spectacular aerial artist, Colette Marchant (Eva Green), until Holt learns that beneath its shiny veneer, Dreamland is full of dark secrets.Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyDumbo/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dumboInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dumbo/"

Video game bad guy Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope’s video game, Sugar Rush.

Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site “BuzzzTube.” Directed by Rich Moore (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph”) and Phil Johnston (co-writer “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Cedar Rapids,” co-writer “Zootopia,”), and produced by Clark Spencer (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Bolt”), “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-Ralph 2” hits theaters on Nov. 21, 2018.See more from Wreck-It Ralph:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WreckItRalph/Twitter: https://twitter.com/wreckitralphInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wreckitralph/See more from official Disney Animation:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimationTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneyanimationWelcome to the official Walt Disney Animation Studios YouTube channel!

Scott Ellis (the 2016 Broadway revival of “She Loves Me,” “Weeds”) is an executive producer and will serve as the director overseeing the stage direction. Alex Rudzinski (“Grease: Live,” “Dancing with the Stars”) is an executive producer and will serve as the live television director.

Broderick joins previously announced Emmy Award nominee Maya Rudolph (“Saturday Night Live,” “Bridesmaids”) in the three-hour live musical production. After a nationwide digital casting call, 11-year-old Andy Walken, from Seattle, WA, has been cast in the role of “Ralphie Parker. Tony Award winner Jane Krakowski (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “30 Rock”) and Emmy Award nominee Chris Diamantopoulos (“Good Girls Revolt,” “Silicon Valley,” “Episodes”) have been cast in featured roles.\n\nCount On Christmas Performance ft.

A golden thread, presented to her at godfather Drosselmeyer’s (Morgan Freeman) annual holiday party, leads her to the coveted key—which promptly disappears into a strange and mysterious parallel world. It’s there that Clara encounters a soldier named Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight), a gang of mice and the regents who preside over three Realms: Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers and Land of Sweets. Clara and Phillip must brave the ominous Fourth Realm, home to the tyrant Mother Ginger (Helen Mirren), to retrieve Clara’s key and hopefully return harmony to the unstable world. Starring Keira Knightley as the Sugar Plum Fairy and featuring a special performance by Misty Copeland, Disney’s new holiday feature film “The Nutcracker and the Four Realms” is directed by Lasse Hallström and inspired by E.T.A. Hoffmann’s classic tale.

Mentioned again i would have to pay $75 even if i had insurance and i still would have to wait for a replacement to come in which is most likely a refurbished device.\n- screw it so i sent it to samsung.\n- 3 weeks later got a refurbished phone with light scratches.\n-phone battery drains faster than usual,  apps freezing and crashing. \n-outcome of the situation... i paid full price for a used phone.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n@ 2:32 you can see the flash/line i was referring to.\n\n**UPDATE 12/24/2017\nI finally got the phone back. looks like I got back a refurbished phone. link below is to my other video / unboxing of the note 8.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6z0Nt0VyseM\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCompletely drained my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Battery.

Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. Facing a life-threatening illness, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.In Theaters November 2, 2018Cast: Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aiden Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike MyersConnect with Bohemian Rhapsody Online:Visit the Bohemian Rhapsody WEBSITE: http://bohemianrhapsody.comLike Bohemian Rhapsody on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/BoRhapMovieFollow Bohemian Rhapsody on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/BohemianRhapsodyMovie#BohemianRhapsodyAbout 20th Century FOX:Official YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

Loki is about the same age as Sparta, so we celebrate their birthdays together. He found me at a rescue center in July of 2008.

But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father’s legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)—who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. \n\nJake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious’ Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale. \n\nPacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S. DeKnight (Netflix’s Daredevil, STARZ’s Spartacus) and also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day. \n\n#JoinTheUprising #PacificRimUprising"

Abrams Just Pitched His Star Wars: Episode IX to Disney\n\n2) Third ‘GI Joe’ Gets Official 2020 Release Date; Paramount also dates Micronauts and Dungeons & Dragons\n\n3) Opening This Week – Pitch Perfect 3\n\n4) Director Matthew Vaughn Confirms Talks with DC\n\n“I do love the world of DC, and I’ve been talking to them at the moment about a few things. It’s more fun getting involved with franchises when they’re on the down, because then it’s easier to make a good film. So if I got involved with a few of the superhero films out there that have been disappointing, it’s going to be… if I do OK, it’ll probably be better.”\n\n5) First ‘Ocean’s 8' Trailer \n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nJust as Star Wars The Last Jedi was gearing up to debut in theatres, work on Episode 9 started its journey into pre-production. Via a report from Making Star Wars, during the press conference for the recent Disney/Fox merger, Disney CEO Bob Iger revealed that JJ Abrams would be pitching his Star Wars to the studio on December 15th, the day The Last Jedi hit theatres. Fantha Tracks also revealed that Abrams’ film would be made with the working title “Black Diamond.” The working title for Force Awakens was “AVCO” and “Space Bear” for Last Jedi. Star Wars Episode 9 is scheduled to hit theatres on December 20th, 2019. \n\nYesterday, Paramount Pictures officially announced plans for a third GI Joe movie and dated it to be released on March 27, 2020. Titled simply GI Joe, the plan for the movie is unknown at this time, as is casting and who will be taking on directing duties. Paramount also dated a feature adaptation of the late ’70s Mego/Takara toyline Micronauts for Oct. 16, 2020, with J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot behind the production. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a recent podcast from IGN UK, director Matthew Vaughn confirmed he’s had talks with DC and is interested in helping out the studio after the not-so-stellar performance of Justice League cast more speculation as to what is happening behind closed doors over at DC. \n\nWarner Bros. has released the first Ocean’s 8 trailer for the upcoming spinoff from Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s trilogy. Hunger Games filmmaker Gary Ross directs the new film, which stars Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, the sister of George Clooney’s Danny Ocean. When this film begins she’s fresh out of prison and assembles a team of her own to pull off a unique heist at the Met Gala. Ocean’s 8 opens in theaters on June 8, 2018.\n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Perri: https://twitter.com/PNemiroff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

Gilbert asks Eggert, Alexander says he witnessed this the first year of the show, which would make you 14? Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years.

Her inventions -- designed to chop vegetables, cut hair, apply lipstick and more -- rarely (if ever) succeed, and that's the point. The true beauty of making useless things [is] this acknowledgment that you don't always know what the best answer is, Giertz says. It turns off that voice in your head that tells you that you know exactly how the world works. Maybe a toothbrush helmet isn't the answer, but at least you're asking the question.Check out more TED Talks: http://www.ted.comThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‘return to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander’s household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids – where anyone could be a spy for Gilead – all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her."

The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"

Jerusalem is home to important holy sites for all the Abrahamic religions, and so it has become a critical bargaining chip in the ongoing discussion between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\nPresident Trump's administration announced in 2017 that it would officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and that it planned to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. This would make the U.S. the only country in the world with an embassy to Israel in Jerusalem - there are currently various consulates, but no embassies. The announcement spurred condemnation from various countries, including U.S. allies, and has quickly become a political flashpoint of the Middle East.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019. The company is currently taking reservations for the semi, but a deposit will set buyers back $5,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Welcome to the movement that began as a simple experiment: The First Purge.\n \nTo push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community.  But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.\n\nComing off the most successful film in the series, The Purge: Election Year, creator James DeMonaco (writer/director of The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year) returns alongside the producers of this worldwide phenomenon: Blumhouse Productions’ Jason Blum (Insidious series, Get Out, Split), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and DeMonaco’s longtime production partner, Sébastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).  \n\nThe First Purge is directed by Gerard McMurray (Burning Sands), working from a screenplay once again written by DeMonaco.  www.thefirstpurge.com"

The fictional Maine town of Castle Rock has figured prominently in King’s literary career: Cujo, The Dark Half, IT and Needful Things, as well as novella The Body and numerous short stories such as Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption are either set there or contain references to Castle Rock.

Because everything is in a tilted plane, the hard part was to find different ways of having the marble riding up along the table (magnets, falling weight, catapult ...). To do that, the marble has to be light. And because everything has to be triggered by this little marble, all the tricks are very unstable. Most fails happened when an element fall down earlier than expected.\n\nI learned a lot about chain reaction, and I discovered the amazing power of the hot glue gun !"

No single notes. \n\nA tritone is referring to a particular musical interval (how far away two notes are from each other) and is renowned for it's dissonance and harsh feeling of tension. A tritone name refers to the 3 whole tone distance between the two notes.\n\nIt's used to great effect in a lot of different genres, but straight up 2 note only tritone chords I most closely associate with Deathcore. And I can't think of anywhere else where it's used anywhere near as often. Particular the band Oceano came to mind while writing this.\n\nIt's rumored that the tritone was banned in medieval times, that you could be jailed for using it, that people believed it could summon the devil...  None of which are actually true, but make for a great story that really fits in well with this harsh musical interval.\n\nHere's me chatting about writing this after being thrust into the underworld: https://youtu.be/651DVX5w3Ow\n\nMixed by Ryan Fluff Bruce: https://www.youtube.com/user/Fluff191\nVideo edit by Jake Jarvi: https://www.youtube.com/pineappleboyfilms/\n\nThis video was made possible because of Patreon support from Tianyu Ge, Navin Antoine, Brad Tucker, Jaz Maglana, Blayd Malburne, Andrew Johnston, Cody Melcher, Caleb Chalfin, Otto Cate, Nicolette Kawata, Tyler Feinman, Haroon Rahman, Quintin Waldner, Hypergnome, Stefan Gunn, Andy AKA VaultsOfExtoth, Rob Harper, & many other awesome people on my Patreon page: http://www.patreon.com/RobScallon\nThank you so much!\n\nMusic videos go on the main.

RIP to the very best”.\n\nLiam Payne also paid respects, Tweeting QUOTE, “Oh my god truly devastated for Avicii  very very sad news way to young...what a talent he was. rest in peace x.”\n\nFellow DJ Marshmello simply wrote QUOTE, “At a loss for words…Rest easy brother @Avicii”, while Zedd shared QUOTE, “No words can describe the sadness I’m feeling right now, hearing about Avicii passing away...Thoughts go out to his family and friends…”\n\nSinger Dua Lipa also expressed her shock and sadness, Tweeting QUOTE, “Such sad news to hear about Avicii passing.

On the Season Four premiere, Lucious makes his first public appearance after the explosion in Las Vegas, while all members of the Lyon family have their own interests in Lucious regaining his physical and mental faculties. Academy Award- and Golden Globe-winning actor, director and producer Forest Whitaker (“The Last King of Scotland,” “Arrival,” “Lee Daniels’ The Butler”) will guest-star in a multi-episode arc on EMPIRE, beginning this fall on FOX. Whitaker will play “Uncle Eddie,” a charismatic music icon and bonafide hitmaker, who gave an unknown Lucious (Terrence Howard) his first radio airplay. Decades later, Eddie steps up for Lucious at a critical moment during his rehabilitation, and a grateful Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) invites him to produce a song in celebration of Empire Entertainment’s 20th anniversary.\n\nEMPIRE is a powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and sometimes dangerous world of hip-hop music. The show revolves around the Lyon family and their media company, Empire Entertainment. The founder, LUCIOUS LYON (Terrence Howard), is the king of hip-hop, but his company and reign are constantly threatened by his family, including his ex-wife, COOKIE LYON (Taraji P. Henson); his sons, JAMAL (Jussie Smollett), HAKEEM (Bryshere “Yazz” Gray) and ANDRE (Trai Byers); and a volatile and competitive music industry.\n\n“Santa Baby” ft.

But I experienced a HIKE today on an ice boat called Zephyr III with Bob Mereness at the helm. In this case a hike is when the boat edges up on two of the three runners. Ice boats can get up to 100 mph although today I think we were only going about 50, which was plenty fast for this newby!\n\nSo I started by walking out on transparent ice, so see-through that I felt like I was walking on water. You could see fish swimming underneath. I was questioning my own sanity for just a second but then remembered I am committed to getting the shot no matter what so I charged on about a 1/4 mile into Lake Geneva with my Canon 5D Mark II with 1080p HD video built in. It turned out that a monopod and my 24-105 lens was the perfect combination for the video project.\n\nI hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed making it.\n\nMusic by Secrets in Stereo.

It's a simple question, though the answer is quite complicated. And it varies tremendously based on what car we're talking about. A $20,000 compact is far more simple than the $155,000 Mercedes S560 Cabriolet driven in this video. With that extra cost comes luxuriousness, the latest technology, and all kinds of features that most drivers will never even know the car has. \n\nOften, complexity is associated with unreliability, and though they may often correlate, that doesn't mean complexity causes unreliability. In the case of luxury cars, it's important to consider who the buyer is.

Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‘return to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander’s household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids – where anyone could be a spy for Gilead – all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her."

What began as an unlikely friendship between an adolescent Viking and a fearsome Night Fury dragon has become an epic adventure spanning their lives.  Welcome to the most astonishing chapter of one of the most beloved animated franchises in film history: How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.

As their true destines are revealed, dragon and rider will fight together—to the very ends of the Earth—to protect everything they’ve grown to treasure.For How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, series director Dean DeBlois returns alongside the all-star cast.

Plunging headlong into the campus experience, the increasingly outspoken Deanna—now Dee Rock—embraces freedom, fun and frat boys on her own terms, finding her true self in a senior year no one ever expected.\n\nThe film also stars Gillian Jacobs (“Don’t Think Twice,” “Love,” “Community”), Maya Rudolph (“Bridesmaids,” “Sisters”), Julie Bowen (“Modern Family”), Matt Walsh (“Veep,” “Ghostbusters”), Molly Gordon (“Love the Coopers,” “Animal Kingdom”), with Stephen Root (“Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates”), and Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (“Silver Linings Playbook,” “Animal Kingdom”), Jessie Ennis (“Better Call Saul”), Adria Arjona (“True Detective,” “Emerald City”), Debby Ryan (“Jessie”) and Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”).\n\nMcCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the screenplay and produced through their production company, On the Day. Chris Henchy also produced the film, with Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and David Siegel serving as executive producers.\n\nFalcone’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Julio Macat (“The Boss,” “Horrible Bosses 2,” “Daddy’s Home”); production designer Rusty Smith (“The Boss”); editor Brian Olds (“Central Intelligence”); and costume designer Louise Mingenbach (the “The Hangover” films). The music is by Fil Eisler (“How to Be Single,” “Empire”).\n\nNew Line Cinema Presents, an On the Day Production, “Life of the Party.” Slated for release on May 11, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

Simon's Cat has been made using a variety of animation software over the years. Originally in Adobe Flash. Then TV Paint (and still on occasions) and most recently using CelAction.Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects."

The A frame hut was damaged due to torrential rain and poor design elements considering the wet conditions. The thatch had rotted in the part of the roof that gets shade. Moth larvae and mold grew and consumed the thatch in these places. The hut also tilted forward due to the back post being hammered in only 25 cm into the ground. So on returning to the property (it was cut off by flooded bridge) I began work on a new hut.\nThe new hut was positioned further into the open clearing to get more sunlight. A 3 meter diameter circle was scribed and 12 wooden posts were hammered into the ground, each 50 cm deep for a sturdier structure. Lintels were then tied to the top of the posts joining the posts together. A tripod ladder was made from poles lashed together at the top and a platform lashed to its frame. The roof poles were then attached to the top of the lintels and lashed together at the top to form a conical roof frame, 3 meters at the highest point. Loya cane was then tied on the eaves to act as support for the ends of the palm thatch. \n700 palm fronds were then cut split and thatched onto the roof. The tripod ladder was used to climb up and thatch the roof from the inside. A cap was then made to put on the very top of the cone when the roof was almost finished.\nA drainage moat was dug around the hut and the excavated soil was placed on the hut floor to raise its level above the damp ground. A deluge tested the hut’s water shedding abilities. Torrential rain fell while a fire was kept going inside the dry hut. The drainage moat flowed like a stream during the heavy rain event. \nLoya cane was then harvested and woven between the posts. This formed a low wall. It was then daubed with mud inside and out. The clay from this was taken from the drainage moat. Rain falling into the moat meant that water didn’t need to be collected from the stream to mix the mud. This is another benefit of the drainage moat.\nThe low wall allows light and air into the hut. With a fire going in the central pit, mosquitoes are kept at bay. The central fire pit produces smoke and heat that will hopefully prevent moths laying eggs in the roof (the caterpillars of which eat thatch) and will prevent mold from growing. The hut will be used as an undercover work space for future projects.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages."

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl’s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it’s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award® nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who—a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer—plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch’s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos’ holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018."

My woodburning stove is not the most efficient for primary heating, so I show exactly how it functions and what I can do to make it more efficient, saving wood and money in the process. It's interesting to see my dog, Cali the Golden Retriever, show up on the thermal image and how cool she is compared to the surrounding walls, table and bed that she's lying on.\nThe tiny house should be very easy to heat once the pointing (mortar) is done inside and out and I can use what I've learned on this log cabin to help me design and build the other structures on my wilderness homestead. Working and collecting firewood alone is challenging, so I want to maximize the efficiency of each building in order to make this long term off grid survival situation more economically feasible. If I can reduce the amount of fuel needed to heat each off grid building, I can provide all of the energy I need for free from the property. This is going to require the installation of rocket stove (rocket mass heater) to use the wood more efficiently.\nI have a few upcoming diy projects that this thermal scan technology will help with - the bread oven, the sauna, the workshop and the maple sugar shack.\n\nLinks to Products Used: \n\nSolar LED light bulb 15W \nhttp://amzn.to/2BQvSQ2 \n\n\nAgawa Canyon Boreal 21 Saw\nhttp://amzn.to/2BPV6OF\n\nCopper Fairy lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2BCmF0X\n\nSolar String Lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2DvgU2n\n\n\nBanneton 12 round \nhttp://amzn.to/2ByxwsF\n\n Lodge Dutch Oven\nhttp://amzn.to/2kHuxDQ\n\nFlamen heat resistant gloves up to 500 degrees\nhttp://amzn.to/2l1mRMm\n\nRocksheat baking stone\n http://amzn.to/2kF6eql\n\nMora Knife\nhttp://amzn.to/2BOiv35\n\nLamp OiI\nhttp://amzn.to/2qz0nZ1 \n\nWall Lantern (candle lit)\nhttp://amzn.to/2Dpa0MK \n\nMoka Pot\nhttp://amzn.to/2DEomvO  Canada\nhttp://amzn.to/2ndmtw6  USA\n\nCanon 6D\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdaZjs\n\nDJI Mavic Pro\nhttp://amzn.to/2DHuJib\n\nBragg's Sprinkle\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdouzK\n\nTo see what I’m up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) – https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram – https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMailing Address:\nP.O.

I used semi-sweet baking chocolate for the chocolate. You can use whatever you want. You can use a friggin Snickers™ for all I care. That would probably be awesome. If you make the chocolate and coconuts ones, you don't need to bake them. Just wangjangle and shape."
